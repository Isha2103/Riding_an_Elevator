# Riding_an_Elevator

###### I have built a simple program using Python that simulates riding an elevatorüè¢.
*In this program, I have used conditional loop (if-else) and function call method. When you will run this program it will ask you to choose the floor to your destination and then you can continue accordingly.:innocent:*
